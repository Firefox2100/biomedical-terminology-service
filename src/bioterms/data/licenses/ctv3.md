## Original license terms

The CTV3, after its retirement, is merged into the SNOMED UK derivative. Now it's listed under the SNOMED CT license for UK users. The original text of the license is as follows:

**UKTC SNOMED CT® licence**

**SNOMED CT® UK NATIONAL RELEASE AFFILIATE LICENCE AGREEMENT**

**IMPORTANT NOTICE - PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY**

This is a Licence Agreement between (1) **The Secretary of State for Health acting through its agency The Health and Social Care Information Centre**, 1 Trevelyan Square, Boar Lane, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS1 6EB (the "**Licensor**") and (2) the person or organisation to which the UK National Release of SNOMED CT is distributed or otherwise made available (the "**Licensee**").

The UK National Release comprises the International Release of SNOMED CT together with the UK National Extensions and UK National Derivatives and other documents and software. The licence terms for the UK National Extensions and UK National Derivatives are set out in this Licence Agreement. There is a separate licence for the International Release of SNOMED CT.

By downloading, accessing or using any part of the UK National Release of SNOMED CT, or exercising any rights granted under this Licence Agreement, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Licence Agreement and the SNOMED CT International Release Affiliate Licence.

License Fees and other conditions and restrictions apply to the use of the International Release of SNOMED CT in a Non-Member Territory, and to the deployment, distribution and licensing of Licensee Products within a Non-Member Territory. In this regard the Licensee’s attention is drawn in particular to **clause 7 (License Fees)** and c**lause 9 (Use in Member Territories and Non-Member Territories)**.

3.5 The Licensee shall, if requested by the Licensor, transfer to the Licensor or such other person as the Licensor may nominate (including the IHTSDO) all of its Intellectual Property Rights in any Standards-Based Third Party Extensions (or parts thereof) created by the Licensee as the Licensor may specify.

Following due consideration of the matter, including consideration of any information presented by the Licensee, the Licensor shall inform the Licensee whether the proposed modification shall be made and if the Licensor agrees that the proposed modification should be made, the Licensor shall give a non-binding indication of when, reasonably and in good faith, it anticipates that the proposed modification will be made. If the Licensee would like the content of the proposed modification to be developed more quickly than the Licensor has indicated, the Licensee may itself undertake or procure the undertaking of the development of the content of the proposed modification (outside of any existing Licensor’s support services contract). On receipt of the developed content of the proposed modification, the Licensor will then give due consideration as to whether the developed content meets the Licensor’s quality assurance, other governance processes, the Standards and Regulations. If the developed content meets the Licensor’s quality assurance, other governance processes, the Standards and Regulations then the Licensor shall incorporate the modification into the UK National Extension or UK National Derivative, as appropriate, according to its schedule which will give due consideration as to when the proposed modification shall be incorporated into the UK National Extension or UK National Derivative, taking into account other proposals for the modification of the UK National Extension or UK National Derivative and the work required to include the proposed modification in the UK National Extension or UK National Derivative.
